## Other Solutions

If I had more time and this project needs to be done for **production**, I would take one or combination of these solutions:

- I used **Binary Search** to find the result. As a result in the worst case scenario with 13580079 records in the csv file, it takes 24 steps to find the records. There might be a better search algorithm. I need to do more research on this.

- Using **Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)** or in general Hadoop technology would be the right solution for me to take in terms of working with big data.

- Another thing would be split the file in smaller chunks and then in parallel, search for an IP. By doing this not only ONE machine is looking for the query, some computers at the same time would look for the result and we will get to the answer faster.

- My last point would be using a different language. Maybe **Python** or **Java** would be a better option when it is time to work with big data. I personally am comfortable with both languages but not expert and would like to take that challenge if I had more time to do this project.
## In production
Finally if it was production I would:
- Use route system to have user friendly URL

- HTML and CSS for a better UX and UI

- Use full MVC methodology. I only have Models and Controllers for this demo.

- HTML template engine e.g. smart, blade or twig to have better output.

## Tools I used
I used phpstorm and composer. Many useful shortcuts and personal snippet helped me to write faster and more code.

## How much time I spent
Within the first 2 hours I could manage to find IPv4 and its range. It was a good challenge, so I spend 1 more hours to make IPv6 works too.
